Further notes on Kotlin
-----------------------

Corda is written in a language called `Kotlin <https://kotlinlang.org/>`_. Kotlin is a language that targets the JVM
and can be thought of as a simpler Scala, with much better Java interop. It is developed by and has commercial support
from JetBrains, the makers of the IntelliJ IDE and other popular developer tools.

Kotlin is a relatively new language and is extremely easy to learn. It is designed as a better Java for industrial
use and, as such, the syntax was carefully designed to be readable even to people who don't know the language, after only
a few minutes of introduction. Additionally, at R3, we find that all of our developers are up to productive writing speed
in Kotlin within their first week.

Due to the seamless Java interop the use of Kotlin to extend the platform is *not* required and the tutorial shows how
to write contracts in both Kotlin and Java. You can `read more about why Kotlin is a potentially strong successor to Java here <https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-kotlin-is-my-next-programming-language-c25c001e26e3>`_.
