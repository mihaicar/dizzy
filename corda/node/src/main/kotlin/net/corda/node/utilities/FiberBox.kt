/**
 * Modelled on [ThreadBox], but with support for waiting that is compatible with Quasar [Fiber]s and [MutableClock]s.
 *
 * It supports 3 main operations, all of which operate in a similar context to the [locked] method
 * of [ThreadBox].  i.e. in the context of the content.
 * * [read] operations which acquire the associated lock but do not notify any waiters (see [readWithDeadline])
 * and is a direct equivalent of [ThreadBox.locked].
 * * [write] operations which are the same as [read] operations but additionally notify any waiters that the content may have changed.
 * * [readWithDeadline] operations acquire the lock and are evaluated repeatedly until they no longer throw any subclass
 * of [RetryableException].  Between iterations it will wait until woken by a [write] or the deadline is reached.  It will eventually
 * re-throw a [RetryableException] if the deadline passes without any successful iterations.
 *
 * The construct also supports [MutableClock]s so it can cope with artificial progress towards the deadline, for simulations
 * or testing.
 *
 * Currently this is intended for use within a node as a simplified way for Oracles to implement subscriptions for changing
 * data by running a flow internally to implement the request handler (see [NodeInterestRates.Oracle]), which can then
 * effectively relinquish control until the data becomes available.  This isn't the most scalable design and is intended
 * to be temporary.  In addition, it's enitrely possible to envisage a time when we want public [FlowLogic]
 * implementations to be able to wait for some condition to become true outside of message send/receive.  At that point
 * we may revisit this implementation and indeed the whole model for this, when we understand that requirement more fully.
 *
 * TODO: We should consider using a [Semaphore] or [CountDownLatch] here to make it a little easier to understand, but it seems
 *       as though the current version of Qasar does not support suspending on either of their implementations.
