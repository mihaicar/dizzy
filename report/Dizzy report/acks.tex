I would like to thank Dr Anandha Gopalan for his invaluable help and support - I feel so fortunate to have been supervised and guided by him throughout this project.

I would also like to thank my friends Dom, Ab, Elias, David and Giacomo for teaching me that the dissertation is not the only important part of a final year student's life, along with my mother and the rest of my family for their encouragement during my \textit{Imperial years}.
